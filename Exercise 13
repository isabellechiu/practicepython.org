#Exercise 13
#Fibonacci
#Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them.
# Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions.
# Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.
#(Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence.
# The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)

#My answer
from typing import List, Any, Union

seq = int(input("Enter the number to generate the Fibonnaci sequence:"))

def f_seq(seq):
    list = []
    seq = len(list)

    if seq == 0:
        list = [1]
    elif seq == 1:
        list = [1,1]
    elif seq >= 2:
        list.append(list[seq-1] + list[seq-2])



    return print("This is the sequence;", list[0:seq])

print(f_seq(seq))

Not correct answer:
This is the sequence; []

#The answer don't know about the while code
def gen_fib():
    count = int(input("How many fibonacci numbers would you like to generate? "))
    i = 1
    if count == 0:
        fib = []
    elif count == 1:
        fib = [1]
    elif count == 2:
        fib = [1,1]
    elif count > 2:
        fib = [1,1]
        while i < (count - 1):
            fib.append(fib[i] + fib[i-1])
            i += 1

    return fib

gen_fib()
#The while loop Example:
# i = 1
# number entered by user = 10
# the current state of the fib list is [1,1] because the number entered is bigger than 2
# while i < (num - 1) defines that the while loop stops after the number entered by the user is reached
# (the minus 1 makes sure it`s the exact number because indexes start at 0 instead of 1)
# fib.append(fib[i] + fib[i-1]) takes the current value of i as an index, adds the number before that and appends the final value to the fib list.
# With the example I used the function would say:
# 1. iteration of the while loop: fib.append(fib[1] + fib[0])
# (fib[0] is the first value in the current list so it would be 1, fib[1] is the second value in the list, which is also 1. the value that is appended would be 1+1=2)
# 2. fib.append(fib[2] + fib[1])
# (same goes here: fib[2] is the newly generated third value in the list which is 2, the second value is 1; 1+2 = 3)
# 3. fib.append(fib[3] + fib[2])
# (fib[3] = 3; fib[2]= 2 so the added value is 3+2 = 5)
# the i += 1 is the same as i = i+1. That just keeps the index moving forward.


#The other answer (This is the best)
total = int(input("How many? "))
numfib = [1, 1]
for i in range(1, total):
    numfib.append(numfib[i] + numfib[i-1])
print(numfib[0:total])
