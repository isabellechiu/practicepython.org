#Exercise 7
# List Comprehensions
#Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
#Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

#My answer
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
b = []
c = []
for i in a:
    if i % i**1/2 == 0:
        b.append(i)
    else:
        c.append(i)
print(b)
print(c)

#My answer write in a line
e = [i for i in a if i % 2 == 0]
f = [i for i in a if i % 2 != 0]
print(e)
print(f)

#The answer
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
d = [number for number in a if number % 2 == 0]
print(d)
