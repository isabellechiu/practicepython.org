#Exercise 9
#Guessing Game One

#Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then
#tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. (Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very first exercise)

#Extras:

#1.Keep the game going until the user types “exit”

#2.Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.


#My answer -1
import random
list = random.sample(range(1, 9), 1)
user = int(input("Enter a number:"))
if user < list:
    print("you guess too low.")
elif user == list:
    print("You guess exactly right.")
else:
    print("You guess too high.")
#output:
#TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'list'

#My answer -2
import random
list = int(random.sample(range(1, 9), 1))
user = int(input("Enter a number:"))
if user < list:
    print("you guess too low.")
elif user == list:
    print("You guess exactly right.")
else:
    print("You guess too high.")
output:
TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'list'

#My answer -3
import random
list = str(random.sample(range(1, 9), 1))
user = str(input("Enter a number:"))
if user < list:
    print("you guess too low.")
elif user == list:
    print("You guess exactly right.")
else:
    print("You guess too high.")
output:
error: always "you guess too low."

#Difference between random.randint and random.sample
# random.sample(range(1,101),1) will return a singleton list containing an integer, whereas random.randint(1,100) will directly return the integer itself.
# Note that random.randint is an inclusive bound (i.e. it can return either of the endpoints)
# You could also use random.choice(range(1, 101)) to get the integer.
# In any case, I'd assume that randint is the fastest option.

#My correct answer
import random
count = 1
user = 0
list = random.randint(1, 9)
# or list = random.choice(range(1, 9))
